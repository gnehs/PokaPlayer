## Get Started
- If you need to listen to your local music, you will need a Synology NAS with Audio Station installed, or you can try the [Open Audio Server](https://github.com/openaudioserver/open-audio-server) which is compatible with the Audio Station API. 
- Deploy [Mongo](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) containers 
    - init database
```bash
# docker exec
$ docker exec -it <container name> bash
# enter mongo
$ mongo
# create database and user
$ db.createUser(
        {
            user: "<user for database which shall be created>",
            pwd: "<password of user>",
            roles: [
                {
                    role: "readWrite",
                    db: "<database to create>"
                }
            ]
        }
);
# exit mongo
$ exit
# exit docker
$ exit
```
- Fill out the configuration file according to config-simple.json 
- Deploy [PokaPlayer](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/gnehs/pokaplayer) container(optional [neteasecloudmusicapi](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/gnehs/neteasecloudmusicapi-docker))
    - Mount the configuration file to `/app/config.json`
    - Connect the mongo container
    - export port 3000
- Done!
